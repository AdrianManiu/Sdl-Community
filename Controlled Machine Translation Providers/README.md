# Controlled Machine Translation Providers


This Studio 2014 plugin is a new translation provider that will allow you to enable or disable machine translation providers during translation of a document. Once you install the plugin this new provider will be available to be selected and configured. This is a special provider since it will allow the user to select other machine translation providers. It has an implicit number of machine translation providers but others can be added (please bare in mind that it only works with machine translation providers). Once you have the selected your machine translation providers you will be able to configure each one with specific details.

During translation of a document you can go to the advanced section in the upper menu and in there you will find an enable/disable button. The same can be achieved using shortcut **ALT+SHIFT+M**.
