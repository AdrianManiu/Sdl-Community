# Export to Excel

Add a new Batch Task to Studio that can export your project files (SDLXLIFF files) to Excel. 
There is no import facility with this task but having the content in Excel allows for various supporting jobs such as:
- reviewing and commenting with full Excel features - editing content easily for conversion to a TMX -
editing content and adding data for conversion to a termbase - using as a termbase with the new Excel Terminology Provider
