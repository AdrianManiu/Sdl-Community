##Introduction

This app is for the professional version of Studio only because it uses the project automation api.
The basic functionality is the automatic creation of Studio projects based on translatable files being dropped into watch folders 
that are defined by you. You can have as many watch folders as you like and these can be local on your computer, or in dropbox, 
google drive or any other location you wish to use. Each watch folder has its own project template so you have good flexibility in
being able to automate the project creation process for different clients/domains.
