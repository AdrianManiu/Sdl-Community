# Studio InQuote

SDL Studio InQuote takes an analysis from any SDL Trados Studio Project, and creates a quote.

- The quote can be created in MS Word, MS Excel or copied to your clipboard.
- Rates can be added as simple word analysis, standard lines or grouped analysis.
- Client details can be saved in the app and assigned specific rates.
- Customize your own MS Word or MS Excel template.
- Localize the app yourself in your chosen language.

PLEASE NOTE: THIS APP CAN ONLY BE INSTALLED IF YOU HAVE SDL TRADOS STUDIO 2014 ON YOUR COMPUTER

Once installed, you will now find SDL Studio InQuote on your desktop as a shortcut where it opens as a stand alone app outside of SDL Trados Studio.
