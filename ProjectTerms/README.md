# Project Terms

** First Part **
The first part of this plug-in is a batch task called "Extract Project Terms" witch helps the user to extract words from a project file or from some selected files based on some criteria like: number of occurrences, length, and you can exclude some words from the resulting file, using blacklist facilities.
Blacklist can be stored to a .txt file using Save button, can be loaded if there is already one in your Studio project, can be modified using Add, Delete and Reset buttons.
Once the user have finished with the settings, the user can see the result .sdlxliff file added to your project and also the user can analyze a short report of your batch task.

** Second part **
After the user translates the resulted file in one or in all the target languages, he can create the termbase by right-clicking the file and choosing "Generate Termbase" action.
This action will save your termbase in the Documents-->Studio-->Termbases folder and will load it into your ProjectSettings-->Language Pairs-->All Language Pairs-->Termbases
