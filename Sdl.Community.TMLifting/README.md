# Reindex Translation Memories

##Introduction

This Studio 2014 application allows you to select file based translation memories and reindex them. This can be handy when you have mutliple translation memories that you would like to reindex. 

You can select the tm's to be reindex in the following ways:

1. Drag drop tm files
2. Drag drop a folder which contains tm files. The application will look after tm files in subfolders too.
3. Use the browse button to select a folder.
4. Load tm's that are already configured in Studio.
