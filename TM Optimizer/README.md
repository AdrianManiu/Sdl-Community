##Using TM Optimizer

After installation, start TM Optimizer from the Start menu under SDL->TM Optimizer.

On the first page of the TM Optimizer wizard, you have two choices, depending on your situation:
            
1. **Convert Workbench translation memory:** Use this option when you have not yet converted your Workbench TM for use in Studio. You will need a TMX export of the Workbench TM you want to convert.
1. **Optimize already converted Workbench translation memory:** Use this option when you have already converted your Workbench TM to a Studio TM but are having problems caused by excessive formatting tags. You will need your Studio TM and a TMX export of your original Workbench TM.
