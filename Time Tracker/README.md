# Time Tracker

Studio Time Tracker plugin for SDL Trados Studio is a complete environment for tracking and maintaining the time that you are spending while working on SDL projects. 
It is fully integrated with the Studio API, allowing for full automation in tracking the activities as the user is working on the documents; quite simply, It tracks the time for you so you don’t have to!

It provides a rich interface covering all the requirements for maintaining the properties of the project activities 
(i.e. hours, rates, type of activity etc…) including integrated navigation & filtering.

Once installed, restart SDL Trados Studio to find Studio Time Tracker as a new option in the navigation menu on the left side 
of the interface.
