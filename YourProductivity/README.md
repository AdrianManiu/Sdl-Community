# #YourProductivity

Measure #YourProductivity and compete against translators around the globe for fantastic prizes!

SDL’s #YourProductivity app counts the keystrokes you save with SDL Trados Studio’s many productivity-boosting features, and converts them into points. You can then share your points on Twitter to challenge translators worldwide for a place on the SDL Productivity Leaderboard. Each month the top 3 most productive translators, along with 4 lucky users selected at random, will receive Amazon gift cards worth up to €150. Challenge yourself to be more efficient with your projects as time goes on, or vie with your fellow translators for the top spot; the choice is yours!
