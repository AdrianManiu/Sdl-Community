# Your Studio

Your SDLStudio allows you to customize the ‘More Resources’ tab on the SDL Trados Studio home screen.

- Link up to your favourite websites from within Studio.
- Works with all supported languages in the Studio user interface (UI).

PLEASE NOTE: THIS APP CAN ONLY BE INSTALLED IF YOU HAVE SDL TRADOS STUDIO ON YOUR COMPUTER.

Once installed, you will now find Your SDLStudio on your desktop as a shortcut where it opens as a stand alone app outside of SDL Trados Studio.
